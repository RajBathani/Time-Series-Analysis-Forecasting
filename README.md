# Time-Series-Analysis-Forecasting
This study proposes a comparative study of chosen time series forecasting techniques. This
dissertation intends to present time series forecasting techniques such as Autoregression,
Moving Average, Smoothing Techniques and Prophet System. This thesis is focused on
providing empirical comparison between all selected models in a selected business application
context. In order to perform forecasting, time series datasets have been gathered. The chosen
datasets are as follows: 1) Stock Data of Amgen and 2) Daily Minimum Temperature Data.
Datasets have been chosen based upon their statistical properties. This thesis describes the
forecasting process and necessary statistical tests to be performed prior fitting a forecasting
model. This thesis talks about Literature Analysis on Data Mining Techniques to forecast
Stock prices.
Thus, this research aims at making comparison between all models by fitting them on both
datasets. At the end, it also aims at forecasting future values and compare the performance of
the models in selected business context.
